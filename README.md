# SeaBloom ðŸª¸ðŸŒŠ

The world is changing rapidly, and not for the better. Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today, and the consequences are all around us. Perhaps one of the most overlooked but significant impacts of climate change is its effect on our oceans - especially on our reefs.

They provide a home to over 25% of all marine life and support the livelihoods of 500 million in over 100 countries, even though they cover less than 1% of the ocean itself. Not just that, but coral reefs are estimated to suck up carbon at a rate of up to 70 to 90 million tonnes per year, making them one of the most efficient carbon sinks on the planet. To put that in perspective, this is equivalent to the annual carbon emissions from approximately 2,000,000 passenger cars.

Our future is on the line every time coral is bleached since it means all the people/animals dependent on them will suffer + climate change will worsen.

This is when SeaBloom "bloomed", a system which uses AI models (CNNs and RNNs) + LiDAR to detect and pinpoint healthy corals to later selectively breed and transplant. As we dive deeper into the future, I hope SeaBloom will help us nurture our connection with the oceans and our Earth. Together, we can forge a path towards a more sustainable and resilient future for our oceans and the remarkable coral reefs that grace their depths.
